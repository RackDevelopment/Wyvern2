<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Wyvern is a modern server software focusing on improving the Minecraft Server for optimization and performance.

In recent years, there has been a lot of improvements in Minecraft. For example, version 1.13 to version 1.15 are the best in terms of performance. The main goal of this project is to improve Minecraft Server software for even more optimization and higher performance.

Wyvern focuses on improving four aspects from the base Minecraft Server. They are Security, Reliability, and of course, Optimization and Performance. Some of the largest Minecraft Servers still run outdated Minecraft versions, with the performance dropping at higher player counts on newer versions. We aim to fix that and bring high-performance Server Software to everyone, at no cost.
